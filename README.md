# Pathfinding with A* Algorithm in Python
This project implements the A* pathfinding algorithm on a 2D grid, allowing users to define start and end points, place obstacles, and visualize the computed path. It is an excellent starting point for understanding heuristic search methods in graph traversal and can serve as a foundation for more complex pathfinding systems.

## Features
- Grid-based Navigation: Simulates a 2D grid for efficient pathfinding.
- User-Defined Obstacles: Allows custom placement of multiple types of obstacles to test various scenarios.
- A Pathfinding Logic:* Utilizes the A* algorithm for optimal path calculation.
- Heuristic Optimization: Implements the Manhattan distance heuristic for efficient node scoring.
- Dynamic Node Management: Efficient handling of open and closed node sets for rapid path computation.
- Interactive User Input: Allows users to define grid size, obstacles, start, and end points.
- Path Metrics: Reports the total path cost and the number of nodes explored.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language.
- Algorithms: A* for optimal pathfinding.
- Data Structures: Lists, sets, and dictionaries for efficient node tracking.
